**Key motivation:** *a video may convey multiple sentiments and each sentiment appears with varying lengths and locations.* Images come from ***"The Wolf of Wall Street"***.

This repository contains the official implementation of our work in ACM MM 2022. TSL-300 dataset and pytorch training/validation code for **weakly-supervised framework TSL-Net** are released. More details can be viewed in our paper. [[PDF]](./assests/acm22_zzc_videosenti_official.pdf) [[Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znZZMq6YdBg)


## Abstract

<img src="./assests/fig1motivation.png" width="50%" align="right">Video sentiment analysis aims to uncover the underlying attitudes of viewers, which has a wide range of applications in real world. Existing works simply classify a video into a single sentimental category, ignoring the fact that sentiment in untrimmed videos may appear in multiple segments with varying lengths and unknown locations. To address this, we propose a challenging task, *i.e.*, **T**emporal **S**entiment **L**ocalization (**TSL**), to find which parts of the video convey sentiment. To systematically investigate fully- and weakly-supervised settings for TSL, we first build a benchmark dataset named TSL-300, which is consisting of 300 videos with a total length of 1,291 minutes. Each video is labeled in two ways, one of which is frame-by-frame annotation for the fully-supervised setting, and the other is single-frame annotation, *i.e.*, only a single frame with strong sentiment is labeled per segment for the weakly-supervised setting. Due to the high cost of labeling a densely annotated dataset, we propose TSL-Net in this work, employing single-frame supervision to localize sentiment in videos. In detail, we generate the pseudo labels for unlabeled frames using a greedy search strategy, and fuse the affective features of both visual and audio modalities to predict the temporal sentiment distribution. Here, a reverse mapping strategy is designed for feature fusion, and a contrastive loss is utilized to maintain the consistency between the original feature and the reverse prediction. Extensive experiments  show the superiority of our method against the state-of-the-art approaches.

## TSL-300 dataset

If you need the TSL-300 dataset for academic purposes, please download the [application form](./assests/TSL-300_Data_Access_Form.docx) and fill out the request information, then send it to ***gloryzzc6@sina.com***.
We will process your application as soon as possible.
Please make sure that the email used comes from your educational institution.

## Data Preparation
1. Prepare [TSL-300](./assests/TSL-300_Data_Access_Form.docx) dataset.
    - We have provided constructed dataset and pre-extracted features.

2. Extract features with two-stream I3D networks
    - We recommend extracting features using [this repo](https://github.com/piergiaj/pytorch-i3d).
    - For convenience, we provide the features we used, which is also included in our dataset.
    - Link the features folder by using `sudo ln -s path-to-feature ./dataset/VideoSenti/`.
    
3. Place the features inside the `dataset` folder.
    - Please ensure the data structure is as below.
